# GetMyReview
<b>How to run</b>  
The website can be run in the folder GetMyReview but it is the basic Django tutorial interface for now as we chose functionality of the code over the website for this checkpoint. Two files are important, the reviews.json and the app.py in the main folder. The reviews.json is a sample (300) of the reviews that we have uploaded. We are currently using files that are too big to upload to github so for now the sample json file will do. If you run the app.py with the reviews.json file in the same folder you will see our cosine similarity, if you change the flag at the very bottom when calling main you can get the review text that is most similar to our query "Looking for good burgers".
